Repository Tools / SCM / Source Repositories : 
----------------------------------------------------------
Project development will happen from different different locations.

Sometimes development will happen different companies also

Manual code intergration is going to take lot of time.

To avoid this problem , we need some tools to integrate our project specific code.

These tools are used to store our project source code

Below are the some of Repository servers using in market.

CVS
Clear Case
SVN
GIT HUB and
Bit Bucket  


Unit Testing Tools
-----------------------
Developer is responsible to perform unit testing

To do unit testing we can use Debugging

To automate unit testing we can use Unit Testing tools

Junit and Mockito


Build tools
--------------
1) we need to download dependencies for our project
2) compilation
3) packaging (generating jar or war or ear)
4) deployment

All the above manual tasks we can automate using Build tools.

ANT
Maven
Gradle etc..
Jenkins & Bamboos (CI & CD)

In project we can see below 3 types of deployments

1) On-demand (we need to request infra team) 

2) Scheduled (in specific times deployment will happen)

3) CI & CD (whenever there is a change in repo deployment will     happen)


Logging tools
-----------------
When we have project in local we can do debugging to identify the issues

When code is promoted to higher environments we can't connect to higher env db with our code so debugging in higher environment is not possible.

To identify issues in higher environments we need to generate log messages for our application.

To generate log messages we will use log4j api

Note : Projects will be deployed in linux machines

We should connect from windows system to linux system to access 
log files.

For that purpose we will  use below log monitoring tools

Log monitoring tools
----------------------------
Putty - on growing logs we can see using putty

WinScp - To copy log files we can use WinScp

Splunk - Advanced log analysis & Reports etc..

Note : Production logs will be mounted to splunk.

Note : Infra team will share log files storing system details

IP address : 19.168.5.36
Username : loguser
Password : loguser@123

Code Review tools
-----------------------
Code review will happen in project to achieve quality to provide bug free code.

By code review we can improve readability of source code

Code review will happen in below 2 ways

1) Peer review (manual review)

Note : After peer review completed, we should review comments to respective developer thru email.

2) By using tools

           - PMD - Eclipse plugin - Programmer mistake detector
           -  Sonar Qube (Customized rules)

Performance Testing tools
--------------------------------
To perform performance testing of project we can use below tools

JMETER - Open source
HP Load Runner - Commercial

Code Coverage tool
-------------------------
It is used to check how much percentage of our code is covered in junit scripts.

Jaccoo

UML tools
-------------
As part of TDD, we need to create UML diagrams.
To create UML diagrams we will use below tools.

MS visio
Star UML
EA (Enterprise Architect)

Bug reporting tools
-------------------------
BugZilla - bug reporting tool

JIRA- project management tool
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SVN
-----

Sub version
It is used to store project source code.
This can be called as Repository Server.

To work with SVN we need to have below 2 softwares

1) SVN Server -- Visual SVN Server

2) SVN Client -- Tortoise SVN and Subclipse plugin

SVN Client is used to connect SVN Server

SVN Server will be installed in only one computer. Admin will take care of SVN Server setup.

SVN Client should be installed in all project team members computers.

Project Manager will send an email to Admin to create Repository for project in SVN.

Admin will create repository for that project and he will share Repository URL to project manager.

PM will send user details to admin.

Admin will create Users and User Groups in SVN Server and he will provide permissions to Repository for only those users.

Admin will share user credentials to respective people.

Note : We should not share our repository credentials with anybody.

SVN Operations
--------------------
Checkout
Add
Commit
Show diff
Update
Delete
Show History
Lock
Merge and   
Revert  etc.


Checkout
------------
Taking project from Repository server is called as Checkout.

Repo URL :  https://server/svn/HIS-Application/trunk

Right click on Mouse -> SVN Checkout -> Enter Repo URL -> Enter Uname and PWd -- > Uncheck save authentiction -> Click on Finish.

Add :
-------
To push newly created files to Repository first we need to add them then only we can push to repository.

Right click on file -> Tortoise SVN - > Add 

Commit
----------
Pushing local changes to Repository server is called Commit.
This is also called as Check-in.

For New Files : 
Right click on file -> Add-> Commit -> Enter comments -> Finish.

If our commit is successful, repository server will generate one unique id. That unique id is called as Revision Number.

For Existing Files:

Right click on File --> Tortoise SVN -> Difference -> Take Update
Merge our changes --> Commit --> Enter Comments -> Finish.

Colors Representation
----------------------------
Green color - > Local code is in sync with repostiory

Red color -> Changes are in local, shoud commit to repo

Blue color -> New files are added, we should commit to repo.
